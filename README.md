# Sequential MaxFlowMinCut

Run with a .bk file as parameter, for example: 
```
./main test.bk
```

## TODO's:
 - Check if there is any other better data structure for the vertices and edges.
 - Look for CUDA libraries to read files faster (if possible).
 - Optional: After reading a .bk file make a binary version of it for faster reuse.
